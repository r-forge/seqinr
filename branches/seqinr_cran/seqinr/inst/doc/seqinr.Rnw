\begin{abstract}
The \seqinr{} package for the R environment is a library of
utilities to retrieve and analyse biological sequences. It provides an
interface between i) the R language and environment for statistical
computing and graphics and ii) the ACNUC sequence retrieval system for
nucleotide and protein sequence databases such as GenBank, EMBL,
SWISS-PROT. ACNUC is very efficient in providing direct access to
subsequences of biological interest (e.g. protein coding regions, tRNA
or rRNA coding regions) present in GenBank and in EMBL. Thanks to a
simple query language, it is then easy under R to select sequences of
interest and then use all the power of the R environment to analyze
them. The ACNUC databases can be locally installed but they are more
conveniently accessed through a web server to take advantage of
centralized daily updates. The aim of this paper is to provide a
handout on basic sequence analyses under \seqinr{} with a special focus
on multivariate methods.

\section{Introduction}

\subsection{About R and CRAN}

R \cite{R, RfromR} is a \emph{libre} language and environment for statistical computing and graphics 
which provides a wide variety of statistical and graphical techniques: linear and 
nonlinear modelling, statistical tests, time series analysis, classification, clustering, etc. 
Please consult the R project homepage at \texttt{http://www.R-project.org/} for 
further information. 

<<nmirrors, echo = FALSE>>=
nmirrors <- function( url = paste(getOption("CRAN"), "mirrors.html", sep="/") )
{
  readLines(url) -> tmp
  dtab <- grep("<table", tmp)
  ftab <- grep("</table", tmp)
  if( length(dtab) != length(ftab) )
  {
    stop("Unbalanced table while reading file")
  }
  if( ! all(ftab - dtab > 0) )
  {
    stop("overlapping table marks")
  }
  nm <- 0
  for( i in 1:length(dtab) )
  {
    nm <- nm + length(grep("http:", tmp[dtab[i]:ftab[i]]))
  }
  nm <- nm / 2
  return( list( nm = nm, nc = length(dtab) ) )
}

 The Comprehensive R Archive Network, CRAN, is a network of servers 
 around the world that store identical, up-to-date, versions of code and documentation 
 for R.
At compilation time of this document, there were \Sexpr{nmirrors()$nm} mirrors available 
from \Sexpr{nmirrors()$nc} countries.
Please use the CRAN mirror nearest to you to minimize network load, they are
listed at \texttt{http://cran.r-project.org/mirrors.html}.

\subsection{About this document}

In the terminology of the R project \cite{R, RfromR}, this document is a package \emph{vignette}.
The examples given thereafter were run under \texttt{\Sexpr{R.version.string}}
on \Sexpr{date()} with Sweave \cite{Sweave}.
The last compiled version of this document is distributed along with the \seqinr{}
package in the \texttt{/doc} folder. Once \seqinr{} has been installed, the
full path to the package is given by the following R code :

<<whereisdoc>>=
.find.package("seqinr")

\subsection{About sequin and \seqinr{}}

Sequin is the well known sofware used to submit sequences to GenBank, \seqinr{}
has definitively no connection with sequin. \seqinr{} is just a shortcut, with
no google hit, for "Sequences in R".

However, as a mnemotechnic tip, you may think about the \seqinr{} package
as the {\bf{R}}eciprocal function of sequin: with sequin you can submit sequences
to Genbank, with \seqinr{} you can {\bf{R}}etrieve sequences from Genbank. This is
a very good summary of a major functionality of the \seqinr{} package: to
provide an efficient access to sequence databases under R.
