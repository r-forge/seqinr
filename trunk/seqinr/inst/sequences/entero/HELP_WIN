the corresponding value (e.g., an author name, a sequence name, a keyword, etc.)
in the dialog window that appears.
x  Click on `make list' button.
The list of sequences satisfying this criterion appears in panel `Current lists'
x  Click on this list. The names of sequences therein appear in `List content'.
x  Click on any name therein, corresponding sequence annotations appear in
panel `text data output'.
x  Choose from panel `Choose shown' what you want to see of the list members:
annotations, sequence, short description, name & length.
x  Click on button `choose annots' to select what parts of sequence
annotations should be displayed.
x  Click on button `edit list' to edit the content of the current list.
x  Click on button `extract seqs. to file' to extract the sequences contained
in the current list.


LISTS

This program deals with sequence lists that group all sequences matching
the retrieval criteria employed. Lists are named by the program list1, list2...
Many lists can be handled simultaneously, and old lists can be used to derive
new ones.
Lists of species and of keywords can also be used for more elaborate usage.


SEQUENCES / SUBSEQUENCES  (for nucleic acid sequence databases only)

Each database entry appears in acnuc as a parent sequence. In addition, each
coding region (i.e., CDS, rRNA, tRNA, scRNA, snRNA, misc_RNA) listed in the
features table of a sequence gives rise to a subsequence spliced from one or 
several parent sequences.
Thus direct, automatic access to coding regions excluding introns and flanking
regions, is possible.
Subsequences are named by adding an extension (e.g., .PE1, .RR2) to the name
of the parent sequence whose features table defines the subsequence.
Subsequences are selected when a `type' selection criterion is used,
possibly in combination with other criteria.


SPECIES

Species names are tree-structured according to the biological classification
of species.
The `species browser' of menu `Browse' allows to easily navigate in the
species tree.


KEYWORDS

All keywords listed in the KEYWORDS/KW annotation lines are attached to the
corresponding parent sequence.
In addition, several keywords are derived from features tables.
The values of qualifiers `/product', `/gene', `/ec_number', `/evidence', 
`/pseudo', `/codon_start', `/standard_name' are attached as keywords to
the corresponding subsequence.

Other useful keywords:
  5'-PARTIAL : for sequences partial at 5'-end                              
  3'-PARTIAL : for sequences partial at 3'-end      
  PARTIAL  :  5'-PARTIAL  or  3'-PARTIAL                                        
  PSEUDO : attached to pseudogenes                                              
  CHROMOSOME n : chromosome # n (also X, Y, W, B)                               
  GENOME : complete genome                                                      
  CIRCULAR : circular sequence                                                  
  MISC_FEATURE: list of all FEATURES items appearing in sequence annotations    
  RELEASE n : attached to sequences entered or modified at release # n    
  DIVISION name : attached to each sequence from division "name" (e.g., EST)

Codes other than journal names:
BOOK    THESIS     UNPUBL     PATENT
********************************************************************************
SEL_TYPE

                  To select sequences of a given type

Sequence type identifies the nature of the encoded molecule (e.g., protein,
tRNA, rRNA). Type should not be confused with molecule which denotes the
chemical nature of the sequenced molecule (e.g. DNA, mRNA, tRNA).

Each entry of a FEATURE TABLE describing a coding region of a DNA
fragment (i.e., CDS, tRNA, rRNA, MISC_RNA, snRNA, scRNA) gives rise to a
subsequence equal to the fragments described in the location of the feature.
The type of the resulting subsequence equals the key of the corresponding
feature table entry. The name of the resulting subsequence is built by
adding to the parent sequence's name an extension uniquely identifying this
particular feature.

Other feature entries (e.g., mRNA, exon, etc...) do not correspond to
subsequences. These may be extracted, though, using option `extract feature'
of button `extract seqs. to file'.

Sequences of a given type are generally subsequences, i.e., fragments of
parent sequences, except if the coding region covers totally the parent
sequence, in which case acnuc does not create a subsequence.

Click on the desired type in the list shown.

Press `make list' (or hit return key) to create the list.
Press `build query' if you wish to compose a query of several criteria
combined with operators such as `and', `or', `not'.
********************************************************************************
SEL_ORGANELLE

            To select sequences encoded in a particular organelle

Organelle (e.g., chloroplast, mitochondrion) denotes the nature of the genome 
that harbors a particular gene. By extension, acnuc also sees `nuclear' as
an organelle.

A nuclear-encoded gene coding for a protein imported to an organelle is seen
as a nuclear gene by acnuc.

Click on the desired organelle in the list shown.

Press `make list' (or hit return key) to create the list.
Press `build query' if you wish to compose a query of several criteria
combined with operators such as `and', `or', `not'.
********************************************************************************
SEL_MOLECULE

             To select sequences of a given molecule

In acnuc, molecule denotes the chemical nature of the sequenced molecule 
(e.g. DNA, mRNA, tRNA).
Molecule should not be confused with type which identifies the encoded molecule
(e.g., protein, tRNA, rRNA).

Thus the sequence of a tRNA gene has DNA for molecule because DNA rather than 
tRNA was sequenced. The subsequence covering the tRNA region has tRNA for type
because this is the nature of the encoded product.

Click on the desired molecule in the list shown.

Press `make list' (or hit return key) to create the list.
Press `build query' if you wish to compose a query of several criteria
combined with operators such as `and', `or', `not'.
********************************************************************************
SEL_STATUS

                To select sequences of a given status

Status denotes the completion level of sequence annotations.
In GenBank, this comes from STANDARD lines of the annotations.
In EMBL this comes from the second field of ID lines.

Click on the desired status in the list shown.

Press `make list' (or hit return key) to create the list.
Press `build query' if you wish to compose a query of several criteria
combined with operators such as `and', `or', `not'.
********************************************************************************
SEL_YEAR

           To select sequences published in a given year

Type the desired year in the box, choose one of the operations:
      >= (after)  = (this year)  or  <= (before).

Press `make list' (or hit return key) to create the list.
Press `build query' if you wish to compose a query of several criteria
combined with operators such as `and', `or', `not'.

Each reference of a sequence has a year. Thus a sequence with several references
may appear as published in several different years.
********************************************************************************
SEL_OPERATORS

       Operators allowing to combine several selection criteria

Elementary selection criteria (e.g., by species, by keyword) may be
logically combined to create multi-criterion queries.

Multi-criterion queries can be built in one of two ways:
 o Use the `Selection Criteria' buttons to specify each elementary criterion,
   complete each such step by pressing the `build query' button, use the
   `Selection Operators' between or before elementary criteria.
 o Type the query in the type-in box of panel `Query' respecting the syntax
   described below.
When the desired query is completed, press the `exec query' button of panel 
`Query' or hit return.

Binary operators are used between two lists:

Button     In query  Result of operation

and           et     elements belonging to both lists
or            ou     elements of either list
but not       et no  elements of list at left but not in list at right

Unary operators are used before a list:

Button     In query  Result of operation

not           no     elements not belonging to the list
parent seqs   me     replace sequences of list by their parent(s)
add subseqs   fi     add to list all subsequences of sequences therein
proj species  ps     to produce the list of species from which sequences 
                     in list come
proj keywords pk     to produce the list of keywords attached to sequences 
                     in list
proj to seqs  un     to produce the list of sequences attached to species in
                     list for a species list or to keywords for a keyword list
desc species  sd     to produce the list of taxa placed below taxa of list in
                     the biological classification of species
desc keywords kd     to produce the list of keywords placed below keywords of  
                     list in the keyword tree

Parentheses  ()  may be used to delimit the range of operators.

Examples:                              Result:                                  
sp=homo sapiens  et  k=hormone         human hormones                           
sp=mammalia et no o=mitochondrion      mammals but not their mitochondria       
list2 et k=atpase                      combine previously defined list2 with    
                                       a keyword-based criterion

********************************************************************************
CLEAR_QUERY

To clear the type-in box of the `Query' panel.
********************************************************************************
EXEC_QUERY

To execute the query composed in the type-in box at right.

Potential error messages appear in the `Status' box below.

The result of the query appears as a new list placed in panel `Current lists'
above.

Species lists and keyword lists are flagged with `Sp' and `Kw', respectively.
Sequence lists are not flagged.
********************************************************************************
SELECT_TYPE_IN

        Type-in box to be loaded with a multi-criterion query.

This box may be typed in directly if the correct syntax is known.

It may also be filled by steps using alternatively buttons of the
`Selection Criteria' (completing each operation by the `build query' button) 
and of the `Selection Operators' panels.
********************************************************************************
SELECT_BY_NAME

        Fast sequence access from their names or accession numbers. 

Type in the type-in box at left each sequence name or accession number, and hit
return key after each name. The `Status' panel below indicates the success
or failure of each request.

When completed, hit button `done' and all selected sequences will be put in
a new list appearing in panel `Current lists' above.

This procedure also allows to build species or keyword lists by entering
species names or keywords (but not both).
********************************************************************************
DONE_BY_NAME

              To terminate a `select by name' operation.
********************************************************************************
SAVE_LIST

   To save in a file the names or accession numbers of the members of a list.

Modify the proposed filename if desired.

For a sequence list, decide what to save:
  o  seq. names:  to save sequence names
  o  accession #s:  to save accession numbers (safer when names change)

and decide how to save (not meaningful for accession numbers):
  o  simple: sequence names, one per line
  o  GCG: produces a GCG file of sequence names
********************************************************************************
EXTRACT

         To copy in a file the sequences contained in a list.

Modify the proposed filename if desired.

Progress of the extraction procedure is graphically displayed and may be
interrupted by pressing the interrupt button that appears then.

Outfile format.
Five types of outputs are proposed. Choose that you want. All but `gcg'
put all sequences in a single file.

Extraction type.
Five types of extractions are proposed.

o  Simple  
Just extract the sequences or subsequences of list.

o  Translate to protein    
Useful for protein-coding subsequences only.
Will translate them in protein on the fly using the adequate reading
frame and genetic code. Does nothing on non-protein coding sequences.

o  Extract fragment    
Allows to extract any part of the sequence(s) in list.
Such part is specified in the dialog box appearing later following the
syntax suggested by these examples:
132,1600        to extract from nucl. 132 to nucl 1600 of the sequence
-10,10          to extract from 10 nucl. BEFORE the 5' end of the sequence
                to nucl. 10 of it. Useful only for subsequences, and produces
                a fragment extracted from its parent sequence.
e-20,e+10       to extract from 20 nucl. BEFORE the 3' end of the sequence
                to 10 nucl. AFTER its 3' end. Useful only for subsequences, and 
                produces a fragment extracted from its parent sequence.
-20,e+5         to extract from 20 nucl. BEFORE the 5' end of the sequence
                to 5 nucl. AFTER its 3' end.

o  Extract feature
Allows to extract any feature listed in the feature table of sequences in list.
Select the desired feature in the scrolling list appearing later.
Meaningful only for parent sequences (subsequences have no feature table)
and to access those features that do not correspond to a subsequence
(e.g., EXON, mRNA, PRIM_TRANSCRIPT, REP_ORIGIN).

o  Extract feature region
Allows to extract a region surrounding a feature of sequences in list.
Select next the desired feature as explained above and the desired fragment
around this feature as explained for option `extract fragment' above.
********************************************************************************
EDIT_LIST

    Edit the content of a list by removing or retaining specified elements.

On the window labelled `list edit' appearing next choose
`remove'   to exclude members of the list
`retain'   to keep members of the list

Then, the list content appears in a scroller, and desired elements can be
selectively removed/retained by clicking on them.

After clicking on button `done' the edited list appears as a new list in 
panel `Current lists'.
********************************************************************************
ADD_PARENTS

       Replace subsequences of a list by their parent sequences

The list is scanned, and each subsequence is replaced by its parent sequences.
Parent sequences are transmitted unaltered.

The resulting list appears as a new list in panel `Current lists'.
********************************************************************************
ADD_SUBSEQS

      Add to a list all subsequences of parent sequences therein

The list is scanned, and all subsequences of each parent sequence are added to
the list. Subsequences are transmitted unaltered.

The resulting list appears as a new list in panel `Current lists'.
*******************************************************************************
DELETE_LIST

              Deletes the list selected in panel `Current lists'

This releases the memory occupied by a list and may be necessary before
creating new lists when many lists have been previously built.
********************************************************************************

root                             (allows to select the tree root)

If one match only is found, the path in the tree through the node found
will be given. All nodes placed under it in the species tree up to the currently
selected `Tree depth' will also appear.

If several matches are found, all of them are displayed. Click on one of them
to make it the current node.
********************************************************************************
CRE_LIST_IN_BROWSER

To create the list of sequences attached to the selected species or keyword(s).

For species:
All sequences attached to the node displayed in reversed video, and to all
nodes placed further down in the species tree, are selected.

For keywords:
All sequences attached to all displayed keywords are selected.
Keywords are also partially tree-structured, so that some keywords indirectly 
select sequences attached to keywords placed further down in the tree.
********************************************************************************
SP_PROF_SWITCH

    To control the depth displayed down the tree starting from the current
                         position in this tree

Note:
When the currently selected `Tree depth' equals its maximum value, the tree is 
explored down to its end. This allows to get the complete species tree
using the `log tree' button.
********************************************************************************
LOG_SPKW_BROWSER

     To write in the logfile currently displayed species or keywords
********************************************************************************
CHOIX_IN_SP_BROWSER

           To change the current position within the species tree

The current node of the species tree is displayed in reverse video.
Click on any displayed node to make it the new current node.

The top line(s) of the form  `[ root; node; node;... ]' gives the position
in tree of the current node.
Click on this line(s) to go up one level in tree.

Use the `Tree depth' arrows to control how much to see down the current node.

Click on button `Create seq. list' to create the list of sequences attached
to the current node or to any node further down in the tree.

Any node prefixed by `Synonym:' may be used equally as the node above it
to select the same sequences.

Lines appearing within {} are taxon comments.
********************************************************************************
KEYWORDS_TEMPLATE

        To get all known keywords containing one or several strings

Enter one or several strings, hit return or click on button `ok'.
All matching keywords will be displayed below.

WARNING: very often the same meaning is written in many different ways!

Click on `Create seq. list' to create the list of sequences attached to all
displayed keywords.

Click on `Create list of matching keywords' to put all displayed keywords 
in a keyword list. This list may then be edited using button `edit list' of the
main window. Finally sequences attached to the edited keyword list can be
selected using the `proj. to seqs.' button in `Selection operators' panel.
********************************************************************************
LIST_MATCHING_KW

                To create the list of all displayed keywords

This list may then be edited using button `edit list' of the main window. 

To build the list of sequences attached to elements of the edited keyword list:
1)   click on `proj. to seqs.' button in `Selection Operators' panel
2)   click on `previous list' button in `Selection Criteria' and choose the
     desired keyword list
3)   click on `exec query'.
********************************************************************************
TOTAL_BASES

         To compute  the total length of sequences in a list

The total appears in panel `Status'.
********************************************************************************
SCAN_LIST

    To scan annotations of sequences in a list for presence of a string

Enter the desired string (or word) in the dialog window that appears next.
Any sequence having this string in its annotations will be put in a new list.
********************************************************************************
DELETE_ALL_LISTS

              To delete all lists that were built until now

May be useful when no more memory is available to build further lists.
********************************************************************************
SHOW_KW_NUMBERS

   Computes for each matching keyword the number of attached sequences.
