\title{ To Compute the Theoretical Isoelectric Point }
\description{
  This function calculates the theoretical isoelectric point of a protein. Isoelectric point is the pH at which the protein has a neutral charge.
These estimate does not account for the post-translational modifications.
}
\usage{
computePI(seq)
}
\arguments{
  \item{seq}{ AA sequence as a vector of chars }
}
\value{
  It returns the pI.
}
\references{ 
The algorithm is quite the same as the one which is implemented at the following url:

\note{ 
Protein pI is calculated using pK values of amino acids described in  Bjellqvist et al. See also \code{SEQINR.UTIL} for more details.
