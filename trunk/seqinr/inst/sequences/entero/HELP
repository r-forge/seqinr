                  ---- SELECT command, simple usage ----                        
   This is the major command of the program. It executes all sequence           
retrievals using any selection criteria the data base allows. The command       
produces the list of all sequences that fit the required criteria. The          
resulting list will be named automatically LIST## by the program.               
The program asks:  "Enter selection criteria (or H for help):"                  
Answer as explained below.                                                      
                                                                                
SYNTAX FOR SELECTION:                                                           
Each selection criterion is written using the following syntax:                 
 c=criterion value    where c indicates which criterion is used                 
Examples:                                                                       
sp=homo sapiens    t=cds     k=hormone     o=mitochondrion    list3             
                                                                                
Possible criteria:      Selected sequences:                                     
 SP=species name        sequences from given (group of) species.                
                        (@ can be used to match any group of characters in      
                        the species name, ex: SP=RATTUS@)                       
 K=keyword              sequences having a given keyword. Since keywords are    
                        tree structured, as are species, you will select all    
                        sequences associated to keywords further down in tree.  
                        (@ can be used to match any group of characters)        
 R=reference code       sequences from a given reference (GENERAL command       
                        explains how to specify references).                    
 J=journal name         sequences published in a given journal (CODES command   
                        lists journal names).                                   
 Y=year or              sequences published in given year (e.g. 1982)           
   Y>year or Y<year     or after (>) or before (<) given year.                  
 AU=author              sequences published by given author(s). Use @ to speci- 
                        fy any letters in name (e.g. @ORMOND@ for Van Ormondt). 
 T=sequence type        sequences of given type (CODES command lists sequence   
                        types and their meanings). You generally obtain sub-    
                        sequences with this criterion because types are for     
                        example tRNA, rRNA or protein gene.                     
 O=organelle            sequences from a given organelle (CODES command         
                        lists organelle names).                                 
 M=molecule name        sequences with given chemical structure: DNA, RNA,      
                        tRNA,... (CODES command lists molecule names).          
 N=sequence name        sequence of given name (note however that FIND command  
                        provides simpler sequence retrieval by name).           
 AC=accession number    sequences of given accession number (can also use FIND) 
 F=file name            sequences whose names are in specified file previously  
                        written by SAVE command.                                
 FA=file name           sequences whose accesion #s are in specified file       
                        previously written by SAVE/AC command.                  
 list name              sequences pertaining to yet user defined sequence list. 
                                                                                
   Criteria can be combined using 3 operations:                                 
      Operation:            Result:                                             
criterion1 ET criterion2    sequences that fit criteria 1 and 2 simultaneously  
criterion1 OU criterion2    sequences that fit at least one of both criteria    
NO criterion1               sequences that do not fit criterion 1               
                                                                                
Examples:                              Result:                                  
sp=homo sapiens  et  k=hormone         human hormones                           
sp=mammalia et no o=mitochondrion      mammals but not their mitochondria       
list2 et k=atpase                      combine previously defined list2 with    
                                       a keyword-based criterion                
   Parentheses can be used to delimit the range of operations. For example:     
(sp=homo sapiens ou sp=saccharomyces cerevisiae)et o=mitochondrion

     In addition to functions described in the help for the simple usage of     
command SELECT, other selection criteria and operations between lists exist.    
Specifically, it is also possible to build lists of species and lists of        
keywords for further retrieval capabilities.

              by a SAVE command).                                               
FS=file name  List of species taken from a file (which may have been created    
              by a SAVE command).

ME list       Replaces subsequences in list by sequences from which they        
              are extracted (equivalent to option 4 of command MODIFY).         
FI list       Sequences in list plus all of their subsequences (equivalent to   
              option 5 of command MODIFY).                                      
PS list       Produces the list of species names attached to sequences in list. 
PK list       Produces the list of keyword names attached to sequences in list. 
UN list       If applied to a species list, produces the list of sequences from 
              species in the list; if applied to a keyword list, produces the   
              list of sequences attached to keywords in list.                   
SD spec-list  Applied to a list of species, produces the list of all descendants
              from them in the species tree. The list itself can easily be      
              created by command FIND.                                          
KD keyw-list  Applied to a list of keywords, produces the list of all           
              descendants from them in the keywords tree. The list itself can   
              easily be created by command FIND.                                
                                                                                
Operators PS, PK, and UN allow to solve the problem "find all genes             
simultaneously sequenced in a given series of species".                         
First, build the lists of sequences from each of these species. Next project    
each of these lists to attached keywords by applying operator PK. Then compute  
the list of keywords in common by combining the keyword lists with operator ET. 
Then, remove from this list of common keywords, those which are                 
uncharacteristic (e.g. partial) by employing command MODIFY. Finally, produce   
the lists of sequences attached to common keywords from each species by         
applying operator UN combined with initial species-based sequence lists.        
Species and keyword lists can be listed with command NAMES and saved with SAVE.

Use this command to build a list of sequences with known names or accession     
numbers. Successively enter the desired sequence names or accession numbers.    
Finish by striking <RETURN> key twice after the last name.                      
                                                                                
You can also select sequences from a template name by using symbol @ to specify 
any number of letters in name. For example  Hum@Tr@ will select sequence names  
starting with HUM and containing TR somewhere after. This procedure will be     
VERY slow if the template begins with @.

This command provides sequence primary structures. Protein coding       
subsequences are translated in aminoacids with the one-letter code. 
Variant genetic codes are used when necessary and their differences from the 
standard code are indicated by the program. For sequences containing 
subsequences, the names and endpoints of subsequences will appear under 
corresponding sequence positions and subsequence descriptions will appear at 
the beginning of the output.

   This command modifies the content of a sequence list in various ways.        
A new, modified list will be created. Option /nl=name can be used to name 
the new list.
Reply to question "List, or H(elp)? [default=...]" with <RETURN> to access the  
default (list of) sequence(s) or with any list name. 
                           
Then choose one of the following 6 options:                                     
  1. Confirmation/Suppression of sequences. Use this option to remove some      
sequences from a list. A one-line description of each sequence in list will     
appear; each time strike key C to confirm, S to suppress this sequence, 
F to confirm all remaining sequences of the list, 
Q to suppress all remaining seqs.

  2. Sequence length: keep only sequences longer or shorter than a specified    
length. You will be asked "Give your length threshold: (ex: L>200 or L<1000)".  
Use syntax suggested by examples to answer.  
                                   
  3. Date of sequence insertion in data base: keep only sequences inserted      
at, before or after a specified date. You will be asked:           
"Enter your date threshold: (ex: <10/APR/82 or >1/JUN/2000 or = 10/may/01)" 
Character < is to be understood as <= and > likewise.
                  
  4. Replacing in a list subsequences by sequences from which they derive.  
    
  5. Adding to a list all subsequences of sequences in list.  

  6. Scan sequence annotations for a string: enter string to be searched;
all sequences having this string in their annotations will be put in the
new list. This command may be interrupted by hitting the <return> key.

Use this to put into a file the names of sequences in a list in order to re-use 
this same list in a later run of the program. Later, to do this, use the        
command SELECT and the selection criterion  `F=file name'.                      
                                                                                
Command  `save/ac'  will put sequence accession numbers rather that names in    
the file. Later that file can be used to create the corresponding sequence      
list with criterion `FA=' of command  `select'. The extension of sub-sequence   
names are appended to accession numbers in the created file to allow direct     
access to the sub-sequence when the file is loaded with `fa='.                  

Command `save/gcg' will save sequence names in a GCG-formatted file of
sequence names.
                                                                                
This command can also be applied to a list of species or of keywords. The saved 
list can be reloaded in memory with criteria `FS=' or `FK=' of command select.

Use this command to delete (in your program only, not in the data base) a       
sequence list and thus have the memory it occupies released to define new       
lists or other purposes. When this is necessary a message will appear.

                    ---- SPECIES command ----                                   
    Helps you find how to select sequences from a species or group of species.  
Give part(s) of word(s) you want to be present in the species name. Give for    
example MAMM if you hesitate between MAMMALS, MAMMALIAN or MAMMIFERE.
    Taxon names found with this command are then to be used in the selection    
criterion "SP=species name" of command SELECT either with their full spelling   
or using character @ to match any character string.                             
    You are then asked "Max depth for tree display?". Species and other taxon   
names are tree-structured. Hence if you search EUKARYOTA for instance you will  
have all eukaryotic species displayed, which can be fairly long, unless you     
limit the exploration depth in the tree under the points that match the         
searched word(s). Depth 2 (the default depth) is recommended, you can then      
re-enter the SPECIES command to further explore the tree.  
    The place in the species tree of all matching names will be given.
    Using in SELECT command the name of a group of species provides sequences   
of all species placed below this group in the tree.

For example RIB TEIN can be used if you think of RIBosomal proTEINs. You can    
also enter ALL to see all keywords (caution, they are numerous). Keyword names  
found with this command are to be used in the SELECT command with the selection 
criterion  K=keyword name  either with their full spelling or using character

   A detailed explanation of purpose and usage of each command is obtained      
by typing the command name and requesting help when the dialog suggests it.     
SEQUENCES AND SUBSEQUENCES:                                                     
   In addition to sequences as published in research articles, ACNUC contains   
subsequences which are sequence segments with specific coding function (e.g.    
protein, tRNA, rRNA genes...). Sequence type distinguishes parent from sub-     
sequences: parent sequences have LOCUS type, subsequences have a type that      
indicates their function (CDS, TRNA, RRNA,...). Most subsequence names derive   
from the parent sequence's name by addition of suffixes .PEn, .TRn, .RRn, .SNn  
.RNn for CDS, TRNA, RRNA, snRNA or misc_RNA-typed subsequences, respectively.   
When the gene name is known, it is used as a suffix in the corresponding        
subsequence name.
SEQUENCE LISTS:                                                                 
   This program deals with sequence lists which group sequences selected from   
the data base using one or more selection criteria (see SELECT help). Many      
sequence lists can be handled simultaneously by the program and previous lists  
can be used to define new ones.                                                 
   Typical use of program is:                                                   
 - SPECIES command to know which species names are to be used in selection.     
 - KEYWORDS command to know which keywords are to be used in selection.         
 - SELECT command to select sequences from data base combining various          
criteria. This command produces the list of sequences that fit the criteria.    
 - SHORT command to obtain a brief description of selected sequences            
or - INFO command to get more detailed information.                             
 - EXTRACT command to copy selected sequences to a user file.                   
LIST NAMES:                                                                     
   Lists are created by commands SELECT or FIND. They are given automatically a 
name (LIST1, LIST2,...) by the program, unless the user enters his own list     
name by appending /l=my_list_name to the command name at the "Command?" prompt. 
Most commands operate either on a sequence list or on an individual sequence.   
Reply to question "List, sequence, or accession #? [default=...]" with          
<RETURN> to access the default (list of) sequence(s) or with any list name,     
sequence name, or accession number.                                             
FILE OUTPUT:                                                                    
If /lpt is appended to command name at the "Command?" prompt, the output of     
commands SPECIES, KEYWORDS, INFO, SHORT, NAMES, CODES, BASES goes to a file     
named `query.out'.                                                              
CODED NAMES:                                                                    
   Coded names are to be used when specifying species, keywords, journals,      
sequence types, organelles, molecules. Specific commands    
(SPECIES, KEYWORDS, CODES) allow you to find these names easily.                
REFERENCES:                                                                     
   To find a sequence from a bibliographical reference use the selection        
criterion "R=reference-code" of SELECT command. Build the reference code as     
follows (journal names are given by CODES command):                             
  journal_name/volume/first_page         for journal articles                   
  book/year/name_of_1st_author           for books                              
  thesis/year/name_of_1st_author         for thesis                             
  patent/patent_number                   for patented sequences

EXTR Nber of lines= 45                                                          
                      ---- EXTRACT command ----                                 
   This command extracts a sequence or a list from data base to a file that can 
be used later by various sequence analysis programs. First, specify the list    
you want to use after question "List or sequence name?".
Next question is:
Current output format is: xxx. Do you want to change it? (y/[n])
Type y to see the list of possible output file formats. These are:
acnuc, gcg (one file per sequence), fasta, analseq, GenBank/EMBL/PIR (sequences
are output in the native format of the database).
Next question is: "Name of output file?" Give here a name for this file.    
   The next question asks you to choose between five options:                   
  *1) Simple extraction: extracts each sequence of the list.
  *2) Translate into protein and extract. Applies only to protein coding        
sequences, i.e., with type CDS. Predicted protein sequences will be written to  
the output file using the one-letter code. The appropriate genetic code will    
be used and identified in the output file.                                      
  *3) Fragments or adjacent sequences. Allows to extract any sequence fragment  
defined by its coordinates in the sequence. Applied to subsequences, allows to  
extract fragments adjacent to the extremities of the subsequence. The question  
"Describe the fragments to be extracted" should be answered keeping in mind     
that sequences are numbered:                                                    
     ....-2/-1/1/2/...../E-1/E/E+1/E+2....                                      
               <--sequence--->                                                  
therefore the following answers will produce these results:                     
  132,1600   will extract from pos. 132 to pos. 1600 of each sequence in list   
  -10,+15    will extract from 10 nucl 5' to 15 nucl 3' of the beginning of     
             each subsequence.                                                  
  E-20,E+10  will extract from 20 nucl 5' to 10 nucl 3' of the End of each      
             subsequence.                                                       
  -20,E+5    will extract from 20 nucl 5' of the beginning to 5 nucl 3' of the  
             End of each subsequence, including all introns, if any.            
  *4) Regions defined by sequence FEATURES. Allows to extract any fragment      
(e.g. mat_peptide, intron) defined in the feature table of any sequence.        
The list of known features in the data base can be obtained by replying H
to question "Feature name? (or H for list of feature names)". 
Each feature is attached to the sequence where it appears as a keyword. Thus by 
SELECTing with K=MAT_PEPTIDE you get all sequences with item MAT_PEPTIDE in 
their FEATURES.    
  *5) Regions adjacent to sequence FEATURES. Allows to extract fragments        
adjacent to items of sequence FEATURES. First answer question "Describe the     
fragments to be extracted" following the rules given in 3) above (here position 
1 is the 5'-end of the feature item, E is its 3'-end). Then question "Describe  
the minimal fragment accepted" to be answered similarly allows to control       
whether a shorter fragment should be extracted when the sequence is too short   
to contain the full adjacent region requested.
