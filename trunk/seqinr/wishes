# This file contains the "wish-list" for the seqinr package.
#
# It should be modified _ONLY_ thru the CVS system so that we can
# keep automatically a trace of past wishes status.
#
# A wish starts with the tag "Dear oracle,\n" and ends with the
# tag "\nYours.\n\n". Add a new wish this way in your local copy
# of the "wishes" file and then "cvs commit wishes" to share it.
#
# Once a wish is fullfilled, just delete it from the local
# "wishes" file and then "cvs commit wishes" with your glorious
# comment.

Dear oracle, 

I would like so much that in the function read.fasta() the sequence 
names not to start with the character ">" because it's extremly 
unpleasant to quote everything.

Yours.


Dear oracle,

I would like so much to build my own local sequence database under
the ACNUC system. I have my sequences in genbank or embl format,
what I would like is a function mk.bk("mydata") that creates all
the index files required by the ACNUC system.

Yours.
