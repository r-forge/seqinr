\title{ Zscore on three strains of Prochlorococcus marinus }
\description{
This dataset contains the zscores computed with the codon model on all
CDS from 3 strains of Procholorococcus marinus (as retrieved from Genome
Reviews database on June 16, 2005)
}
\usage{
data(prochlo)
}
\format{
  List of three dataframes of the zscore of each of the 16 dinucleotides
  on each CDS retrieved from the specific strain.

\describe{
  \item{BX548174}{strain adapted to living at a depth of 5
  meters (high levels of UV exposure)
