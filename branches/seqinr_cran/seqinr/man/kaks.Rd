\title{ to Get an Estimation of Ka and Ks }
\description{
  Ks and Ka  are respectively the number of substitutions per synonymous site and per nonsynonymous site between two protein-coding genes. The ratio of nonsynonymous (Ka) to synonymous (Ks) nucleotide substitution rates is an indicator of selective pressures on genes. A ratio significantly greater than 1 indicates positive selective pressure. A ratio around 1 indicates either neutral evolution at the protein level or an averaging of sites under positive and negative selective pressures. A ratio less than 1 indicates pressures to conserve protein sequence (i.e. purifying selection). This function estimates the Ka and Ks values for a set of aligned sequences using the method published by Li (1993) and gives the associated variance matrix.

\note{ 
 When the alignment does not contain enough information (i.e we approach saturation), the Ka and Ks values take the value 10.
 Negative values indicate that Ka and Ks can not be computed.

 # In this example, Ka and ks are calculated between the human/mouse orthologous genes of ubiquitin.
 # Ubiquitin is involved in many cells processes (replication, DNA repair, apoptosis ...). 
 ub = read.alignment(File=system.file("sequences/UBIQUITIN.mase", package = "seqinr"),format="mase")
 resu = kaks(ub)

 # ka/ks <<< 1, selection eliminates deleterious mutations to conserv the protein.
