  Graphical representation for rearranged nucleotide skews in
  prokaryotic chromosomes.}

\usage{draw.rearranged.oriloc(rearr.ori,breaks.gcfw=NA,breaks.gcrev=NA,breaks.atfw=NA,breaks.atrev=NA)}

\arguments{

\item{rearr.ori}{An data frame obtained with the \code{rearranged.oriloc}
  function. }

\item{breaks.gcfw}{The coordinates of the breakpoints in the GC-skew,
  for forward transcribed protein coding sequences. These coordinates
  can be obtained with the \code{extract.breakpoints} function. }
\item{breaks.gcrev}{The coordinates of the breakpoints in the GC-skew,
  for reverse transcribed protein coding sequences. These coordinates
  can be obtained with the \code{extract.breakpoints} function. }
\item{breaks.atfw}{The coordinates of the breakpoints in the AT-skew,
  for forward transcribed protein coding sequences. These coordinates
  can be obtained with the \code{extract.breakpoints} function. }
\item{breaks.atrev}{The coordinates of the breakpoints in the AT-skew,
  for reverse transcribed protein coding sequences. These coordinates
  can be obtained with the \code{extract.breakpoints} function. }
